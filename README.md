# AudioClassification
This project aims to classify audio data into different categories using advanced machine learning algorithms.The goal is to develop a robust model capable of accurately identifying patterns in audio signals, such as speech, music, environmental sounds, or other distinct audio categories. Various machine learning techniques, including deep learning models and signal processing methods, are employed to extract meaningful features from raw audio data and make accurate predictions.

## Key Features:
#### Data Preprocessing: Techniques such as noise reduction, feature extraction, and segmentation are applied to preprocess raw audio data. Key features like Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), spectrograms, or chroma features are extracted to represent the audio data in a more interpretable form for machine learning algorithms.
#### Modeling: The project explores a variety of advanced machine learning algorithms including:
#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For extracting spatial features from spectrogram images.
#### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and LSTMs: For capturing temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in audio signals.
#### Random Forests and Gradient Boosting: As traditional machine learning models for classification based on extracted features.
#### Transfer Learning: The use of pre-trained deep learning models for audio classification, such as pre-trained CNN models or models specifically designed for audio tasks.
#### Evaluation: Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
#### Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimization of model parameters using grid search, random search, and cross-validation to achieve optimal classification results.
